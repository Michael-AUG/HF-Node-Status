# HF-Node-Status

This short applet for BPQ interrogates the radio (using hamlib), checks that the radio is on the correct frequency and mode for HF packet activity, and returns either a success message (listing the dial frequency) or a failure message (suggesting the user contact the SYSOP).

When installing this for your node, be sure to change the four user altered fields in `hf.sh`.

Then install the application in the normal fashion - for a step-by-step guide visit [the OARC Wiki page](https://wiki.oarc.uk/packet:linbpq_custom_applications).

Happy Packeteering.
